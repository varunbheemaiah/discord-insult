Thank you, but nobody likes a kiss ass.
You sound better with your mouth closed.
I wish you were more fluent in silence.
You know what's funny? Not You.
There's no need to repeat yourself. I ignored you the first time.
The only thing is wrong with me, is I'm talking to you.
I had my patience tested, I'm negative.
If you can't be kind be quiet
